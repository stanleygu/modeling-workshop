      "The **operon** is the fundamental functional unit of the prokaryote genome. It is comprised of a control sequence followed by one or more coding sequences. The control sequence consists of a single **promoter**, the region of DNA that initiates transcription, along with zero or more **operators**. Operators are sequences of DNA where **transcription factor** (TF) proteins may bind to control the rate of transcription for genes in an operon. Transcription factors may function alone or in a complex of other proteins. Transcription factors that increase transcription rates are known as **activators**, and those that decrease transcription rates are known as **repressors**.\n",

      "While *E. coli* usually prefer glucose as a food source, in the absence of glucose it would be beneficial to be able to metabolize lactose sugar, which can be broken down into glucose and galactose. However, it would also be wasteful for the cell to produce additional enzymes when there is no lactose or if glucose is readily available. The **lac operon** is used in regulating this process. \n",
      "\n",
      "One of the genetic products of the lac operon is $\\beta$-galactosidase, which serves to cleave lactose into glucose and galactose. In normal, high-glucose and low-lactose conditions, *lacI* repressor obstructs RNA polyermase from transcribing the genes in the lac operon. In the presence of lactose, the lactose molecules themselves can sequester *lacI* and promote transcription.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is second layer of control for the lac operon. In the absence of glucose, cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels increase. cAMP forms a complex with the catabolite activator protein (CAP). This complex binds to the promoter and stimulates the transcription.\n",
